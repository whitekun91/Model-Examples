# <center> Generative Adversarial Networks Models Examples </center>

<center> A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of machine learning model where two neural networks, <br> </center>
<center> called the generator and the discriminator, are trained simultaneously. <br> <br> </center>
<center> The generator creates synthetic data that resembles real data, <br> </center>
<center> while the discriminator evaluates how similar the generated data is to the actual data. <br></center>
<center> The generator's goal is to produce data that is indistinguishable from the real data, <br></center>
<center> and the discriminator's goal is to accurately differentiate between real and generated data. <br> </center>
